# DND 2024 Quick Reference

## What is this?
This is a DND 2024 quick reference guide. The main point of this is to have open in a separate tab if you use computers during your DND sessions. It's meant to be an easy-to-use way for you to reference quick things in your DND campaigns.

### Home Page
The home page is where most of the referencing comes into play. Many elements exist on this page, telling you each of the actions you can do, separated out into Action, Reaction, Bonus Action, and more.

### Combat Page
Currently work in progress. One-page document meant to explain combat for those who may not quite understand it yet.

### Tools
These are currently in development, but plan to house quick tools for you such as dice rolling and damage calculation.

### About Page
A simple about page to learn about the tool.
